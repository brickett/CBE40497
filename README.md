Projects from this class are listed below!

## Soave-Redlich-Kwong Equation of State for Propane

This program takes the inputs of pressure and temperature.  
Critical properties are constant, since it is only valid for the molecule propane.  
The program outputs molar volume of pure propane.  
Learning outcomes: basic python, numpy
